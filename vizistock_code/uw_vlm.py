First, identify the different categories of products visible on the shelves (e.g., Brass Fittings, Faucet Cartridges).

For each distinct product you can clearly identify, extract the following details:
- description: The name or description of the product from its packaging.
- price: The price listed on the white tag for that item. Extract it as a string.
- type: The specific type of part (e.g., 'Adapter', 'Elbow', 'Connector', 'Cap', 'Cartridge').
Next, analyze the informational sign at the bottom of the image. Extract its main title and the different types of mechanisms it illustrates.

Finally, structure all of this information into a single JSON object using the precise schema below. If a piece of information for a product is not legible or visible, omit the key."""
